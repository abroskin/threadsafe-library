Implementation of a hashmap with mutex on each bucket.
Probably, the better solution would be to have fixed amount of segments each protected by mutex (as it is in Java's implementation)
For resizing also there is one mutex.
Also was not sure if I'm allowed to use c++14 features, but read/write mutexes would've been very usefull here.
Could not use any standard containers, which also would've make the code cleaner.



BUILD:
To build the project run commands:
1.   cmake .
2.   make

RUN:
Call ./hashmap with no arguments to run unit tests.
